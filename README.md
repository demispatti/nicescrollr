## Frequently Asked Questions
#### Where do I interact with this plugin and how does it work?
Please visit the plugin's help tab for further information.

#### Why doesn't it work with my theme?
Most likely, this is because your theme (or another plugin?) already has the Nicescroll library on board. If that's the case, I advise you to uninstall this plugin again to prevent compatibility issues. Of course, you can always ask your theme developer to implement a function to disable the built-in solution if you like to use this plugin and its Options.

The capability required for being able to customize settings is the following:

* `nicescrollr_edit` - The user can change settings regarding this plugin.

#### Are there any known limitations?
There may be issues with scrolling on the backend, if you are using a pen and a graphics tablet.
There may also be issues scrolling over iFrames.

#### Are there any known issues?
Besides the known limitations, no.
